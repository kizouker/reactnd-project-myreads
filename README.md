# MyReads Project

This is the implementation of MyReads project.

## Start

To get started running the project:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`

## Persisting updates

I have used local-storage npm-lib to persist book updates in the browser. 
Now I see that the bookapi provided an update method. I can of course change
this - but my implementation works too.

## Comments
I have only written comments when I find it is necessary - and not self-explanitory.
However - I saw the git comment rules now - by the time I finished the project -
For the next project I will use the standard provided.
